# MMM-KeyPress

This is a module for Magic Mirror software and is solely built to allow user interaction with MMM-CalendarExt3 (https://github.com/MMRIZE/MMM-CalendarExt3).

Once configured, arrow keys will allow the MMM-CalendarExt3 calendar to advance forward and backwards by month. Future updates will include touch integraton (swipes).
